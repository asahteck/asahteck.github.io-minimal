# Project Proposal

Pitch: A projection-based tool for physical desktops to better visualize and translate measurements from computer-aided design (CAD). 

This project can function as an assistive design tool for designers who cannot perceive 3D objects due to a variety of conditions (monoscopic vision/stereoblindness, lacking depth perception, aphantasia, other visual and perceptual impairments) and engages with addresing the accessibility gap in emerging VR/AR technologies.

## Why?
- I have stereoblindness, a friend (from my undergrad mechanical engineering program) has aphantasia, we both struggle to CAD because we cannot percieve in 3D.
  - Most AR/VR technology does not work on me because it relies on binocular cues for 3D perception.
- Would like to find a better way to visualize objects and how they would fit in space before fabricating
  - Engineering design scenes in a movies with hologram displays (re: Iron Man/Spider-Man: Far From Home armor design scenes)
- Holding things up to your computer screen to judge sizes is impractical
  - Estimating measurements is a skill, sometimes hard
  - Zooming in + out of CAD programs messes up the calibrations to real-life measurements

## Potential technologies and inspirations can include:

### Virtual desktop projects
- [The HoloMat Project by ConceptBytes](https://www.youtube.com/@concept_bytes)
  - A fan project to make the JARVIS AI assistant from Iron Man become a projection-based design tool for physical desktops
- [folk.computer](https://folk.computer/)
  - a system using AprilTag tracking to interface physical objects on a desk with projection feedback
- [Sony Futurelab "T" interactive projector concept](https://web.archive.org/web/20180119092408/https://www.futurelab.sony.net/T/)
- [Augmented Reality coffee table (2012)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbiOikirrg)
- Microsoft HoloLens, Apple Vision Pro, and other augmented reality headsets

### Shape-changing displays
- [CADcast](https://tangible.media.mit.edu/project/cadcast)
  - projection mapping onto building blocks for urban design
- [SandScape](https://tangible.media.mit.edu/project/sandscape/)
   - projection mapping in response to changing terrain in a sandbox
   - in general, ispired by a lot of the tangible bits and atoms work in shape-changing displays
- [ShapeCAD](https://shape.stanford.edu/research/shapeCAD/)
   - An Accessible 3D Modelling Workflow for the Blind and Visually-Impaired Via 2.5D Shape Displays
   - crosses into research of CAD for visual impairment
   
## Art
- projection mapping (altering a projection until it no longer appears distorted onto a physical project)
- Pepper's Ghost effect
- Hatsune Miku hologram effects

## Expected Deliverables:

I expect to produce a system utilizing a mini projector and camera connected to a computer, which is capable of projecting shapes and measurements from a live-updating CAD design program.

This may or may not utilize a form of hologram illusion. I hope that my system will be composed entirely of as few parts as possible, all available to be purchased by a consumer, to make this project replicable for individual setups.
